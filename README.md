# Semiconductor Reliability Lifetime Analysis

Modern Semiconductors must operate reliably for years powering everything from cars to smartphones, but testing engineers can‚Äôt wait years to validate reliability. Instead, they run **accelerated stress tests** such as:  

- **HTOL** (High-Temperature Operating Life)  
- **THB** (Temperature Humidity Bias)  
- **TC** (Temperature Cycling)  

These tests simulate years of aging in weeks or months. The challenge is to extract **meaningful reliability insights** from limited, noisy, and often censored lifetime data.  

This project demonstrates such an analysis pipeline using **synthetic accelerated life test data**, combining survival statistics, Weibull reliability modeling, and Arrhenius temperature acceleration.

## Workflow Glance 

- Generate realistic **synthetic semiconductor reliability data** with multiple stress conditions (HTOL, THB, TC) and censoring. 
- Apply **Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival analysis** (with censoring).  
- Perform **Weibull-2P modeling** per stress condition.  
- Use **Arrhenius acceleration modeling** to relate temperature and lifetime for HTOL.  
- Showcasing-quality visualizations **publication-style plots** and reproducible CSV summaries.

## Dataset Overview  

**File:** `data/reliability_synthetic.csv`  
560 synthetic devices tested under multiple stress conditions.  

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Device_ID` | Unique identifier for each device |
| `Test_Type` | HTOL, THB, or TC |
| `Stress_Temperature_C` | Applied stress temperature (¬∞C) |
| `Stress_Voltage_V` | Operating voltage under stress |
| `Failure_Time_Hours` | Time-to-failure or censoring point (hours) |
| `Censored` | 0 = failure observed, 1 = still alive at test end |
| `Batch_ID` | Manufacturing lot ID (captures lot-to-lot variation) |

**Note:** Censoring is common in real semiconductor tests, not all parts fail within the test window. For further analysis, we could think of more features such as, Measurement_No, Parameter_Value, Test_Date and so on.

## Derived Results 

**Median Survival Times**

File: `results/km_medians_by_group.csv` 
- Median device lifetimes per stress group (Test_Type √ó Temperature).
- Derived from Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves.
- Useful for quick comparison across conditions.

**Weibull Fit Parameters**

File: `results/weibull_group_fits.csv` 
- Fitted Weibull-2P parameters for each group.
- Œ≤ (shape): indicates failure mode (Œ≤>1 ‚Üí wear-out).
- Œ∑ (scale): characteristic life (hours).
- Includes MTTF (mean time to failure) and hazard interpretation.

**Arrhenius Regression Coefficients (HTOL only)**

File: `results/arrhenius_fit_coeffs_HTOL.csv` 
- Linear regression of ln(Œ∑) vs 1/T.
- Provides activation energy for temperature-driven aging.

## Key Analyses  

### Kaplan‚ÄìMeier Survival by Stress Group  
- HTOL @ 150 ¬∞C fails fastest (median ‚âà 270 h).  
- HTOL @ 125 ¬∞C lasts longer (median ‚âà 704 h).  
- THB (85 ¬∞C) and TC (-40 ¬∞C, 125 ¬∞C) show little degradation.  

üìà Plot:  
![Kaplan‚ÄìMeier Survival](results/km_by_group_publication.png)  

**My Comment:**  

This was expected since HTOL at higher temperature quickly accelerates wear-out mechanisms like **electromigration** and **oxide breakdown**, while humidity and thermal cycling take much longer to manifest failures.  

---

### Failure Time Density by Test Type  
- HTOL has a broad failure distribution due to combined **temperature + voltage** acceleration.  
- TC and THB failures cluster tightly, with failures clustered around specific stress points.  

üìà Plot:  
![Failure Density](results/density_by_testtype.png)  

**My Comment:**

The wider HTOL distribution reflects device-to-device variation in how quickly transistors degrade. In contrast, TC and THB failures are more uniform since they‚Äôre driven by physical stress thresholds like **package cracking** or **moisture ingress**.  
---

### Weibull Parameters vs Temperature  
- **Œ≤ > 1** ‚Üí wear-out dominated failures.  
- **Œ∑ decreases with temperature** (HTOL), confirming stress acceleration.  
- TC/THB have higher Œ∑ (longer lifetimes).  

üìà Plot:  
![Weibull Parameters](results/weibull_group_params_vs_temp.png) 

**My Comment:**

The rising Œ≤ with temperature means the devices don‚Äôt fail randomly, instead they fail progressively faster as stress accumulates. Lower Œ∑ at 150 ¬∞C confirms **temperature-activated aging** is dominant.  
---

### Weibull Probability Plots (Fit Quality Checks)  
- Empirical points align closely with the Weibull fitted CDF.  
- Confidence intervals are narrow, this is stable estimates.  

üìà Plots:  
![Weibull Probability Plot ‚Äî HTOL 125 ¬∞C @ 4.5 V](results/weibull_probability_plot_HTOL_125C_4.5V.png)  
![Weibull Probability Plot ‚Äî HTOL 150 ¬∞C @ 5.0 V](results/weibull_probability_plot_HTOL_150C_5.0V.png)  

**My Comment:**

Both HTOL groups fit cleanly to a Weibull distribution. This confirms **wear-out is the dominant mode** and that no unexpected early-life (‚Äúinfant mortality‚Äù) failures are present in this sample dataset.  

---

### Arrhenius Temperature Acceleration (HTOL)  
- Positive slope in ln(Œ∑) vs 1/T, shorter lifetimes at higher T supports Arrhenius acceleration.  
- Extracted slope corresponds to realistic **activation energy**.   

üìà Plot:  
![Arrhenius HTOL](results/arrhenius_lneta_vs_invT_HTOL.png)

**My Comment:**

The slope suggests an activation energy in the range expected for **diffusion-driven degradation mechanisms** (~0.6‚Äì0.8 eV). This is in line with published semiconductor reliability models, making our synthetic data look quite realistic.

## Limitations & Future Work  

### Limitations  
- Here Dataset is **synthetic**; real semiconductor data would show mixed failure modes and noisier censoring.  
- Only **temperature acceleration (Arrhenius)** was modeled; real devices require multi-stress models (Eyring).  
- Did not include **degradation parameters** (e.g., leakage, ŒîVth).  

### Future Work  
- Extend to **multi-stress acceleration models** (temperature + voltage + humidity).  
- Incorporate **degradation measurements** alongside failure times.  
- Apply **Bayesian or hierarchical models** for lot-to-lot variation.  
- Project **field lifetime estimates** under normal operating conditions.
- Apply *Machine Learning models** training and predict.
